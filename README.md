# eCommerce-Application "Comic books and manga shop" final task stage 2 RS-2023q4
## Description of the project
The "Comic books and manga shop" project is the final stage of learning within RS-2023q4, where a team of three RS School students collaboratively creates a web application for comic book and manga enthusiasts.

It's an online store offering a wide range of comic books and manga.

Users can browse the product catalog, search for items of interest using various criteria such as genre, publisher, author, etc. They can also read brief descriptions and reviews of products to make informed purchasing decisions.

Customers can create accounts, add items to their cart, and place orders, choosing convenient payment and delivery methods. The ability to rate and leave reviews of products after purchase is also available.

Administrators can manage the product catalog, add new items, update information on existing ones, and manage orders. There is also functionality for inventory tracking and sales statistics.

The project aims to provide convenient and interactive interaction between sellers and buyers, creating a pleasant online space for comic book and manga fans.
