  `My name is Pavel Lukin, and I'm 34 years old. I began my programming journey with Pascal and Visual Basic in school and university, where I studied electric supply engineering. After starting my own comic book shop, I gained experience organizing events like comic book and video game festivals. Recently, I've been exploring C# for game development and frontend technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript. Looking ahead, I plan to delve into React and possibly React Native, along with libraries such as Three.js.`,
